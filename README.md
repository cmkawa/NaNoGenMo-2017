# NaNoGenMo-2017
Novel generator. https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2017/

Named after the scene from American Psycho... because this is probably going to be random, weird, and a little violent.

My program will generate a novel based on source material fed into it, using next-word prediction and style analysis with some adjustable settings for randomness and arc structure. The goal is to get it to produce something readable, reasonably enjoyable, and to see what sort of gems happen to turn up.
